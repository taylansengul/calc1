Let $f(x) = \sqrt{4 - x^2}$. Domain of $f$ is $[-2, 2]$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x = -2$ is the left end point of Dom($f$).
    \item $x = 2$ is the right end point of Dom($f$).
    \item Any $x$ with $-2 < x < 2$ is called an interior point of Dom($f$).
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}
    A function $f$ is \textbf{continuous} at an interior point $c$ of its domain if
    \[
        \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c)
    \]
    $f$ is continuous at its left endpoint $c$ if
    \[
        \lim_{x \to c+} f(x) = f(c)
    \]
    $f$ is continuous at its right endpoint $c$ if
    \[
        \lim_{x \to c-} f(x) = f(c)
    \]
\end{definition}
Note that $f$ is discontinuous at $c$ if
\begin{itemize}
    \item[i)] either $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ does not exist.
    \item[ii)] or $\lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ exists but is not equal to $f(c)$.
\end{itemize}

  \caption{f is discontinuous at $a$ because of (ii) and discontinuous at $b$ because of (i). f is continuous at $c$.}

\begin{example}
    $f(x) = \sqrt{4 - x^2}$ is continuous at every point of its domain.

\begin{definition}
    $f$ is called a continuous function if $f$ is continuous at every pt of its domain.
\end{definition}

According to this definition $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ is continuous!!! $0$ is not in domain of $f$. So we say $f$ is undefined rather than discontinuous at $0$.

\textbf{There are lots of continuous functions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item polynomials,
    \item rational functions,
    \item rational powers $x^{m/n}$
    \item trigonometric functions
    \item absolute value function $\abs{x}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}
    If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $c$ then
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $f + g$, $f - g$, $f g$, are continuous at $c$,
        \item if $k$ is constant then $k f$ is continuous at $c$,
        \item $\dfrac{f}{g}$ continuous at $c$ provided that $g(c) \neq 0$.
        \item $f(x)^{1/n}$ continuous at c provided that $f(c)>0$ if $n$ is even.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let's prove that if $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $c$ then so is $f+g$. If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $c$ then
    \[
        \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = f(c), \qquad
        \lim_{x \to c} g(x) = g(c), \qquad
    \]
    By the limit rule,
    \[
        \lim_{x \to c} (f(x) + g(x)) =
        \lim_{x \to c} f(x) + \lim_{x \to c} g(x) =
        f(c) + g(c).
    \]
    The other proofs are similar.
\end{proof}
\textbf{Composites of continuous funcs are continuous}

If $g$ is continuous at $c$ and $f$ is continuous at $g(c)$ then $f \circ g$ is continuous at $c$. In other words,
\[
    \lim_{x \to c} f(g(x)) = f(\lim_{x \to c} g(x)) = f(g(c)).
\]

\begin{example}
    Find $m$ so that
    \[
        g(x) = \begin{cases}
            x-m, &\text{ if }x < 3,\\
            1-mx, &\text{ if }x \geq 3\\
        \end{cases}
    \]
    is continuous for all $x$.
\end{example}

% \textbf{Continuous extensions and removable discontinuities}

% If $f$ is not defined at $c$ but $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ is defined then we can define a new function
% \[
%     F(x) =
%     \begin{cases}
%         f(x), &\text{ if } x \neq c\\
%         L, &\text{ if } x =c\\
%     \end{cases}
% \]
% $F$ is continuous at $c$ and is called \textbf{continuous extension} of $f$ to $x=c$.
% \begin{example}
%     The function $f(x) = \dfrac{x^2 - x}{x^2 - 1}$ is not defined at $x=1$ but has a continuous extension $F(x) = \dfrac{x}{x+1}$ to $x=1$.
% \end{example}

% If a function is undefined or discontinuous at $c$ but can be redefined at $c$ then we say $f$ has a \textbf{removable discontinuity} at $c$.

% \begin{example}
%     The function $f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2}$ is not defined at 0 but there is no way of redefining $f$ at 0 so that $f$ becomes continuous at 0.
% \end{example}

\subsection*{Continuous Functions on Closed Intervals [a, b] are bounded}
We call a function $f$ to be \textbf{bounded} if there exists $M$ and $N$ such that $M \le f(x) \le N$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

\begin{theorem}
    If $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ then there exist numbers $p$ and $q$ in the interval $[a,b]$ s.t.
    \[
        f(p) \leq f(x) \leq f(q)
    \]
    for all $x$ in $[a, b]$.
    $f(p)$ is called the \textbf{aboslute minimum value} and $f(q)$ is called the \textbf{absolute maximum value}.
\end{theorem}

This theorem is an existence theorem. It only guarantees the existence of $p$ and $q$ but does not tell how to actually find them.

The theorem says that continuous functions on closed intervals must be bounded.

\begin{example}
    The conclusions of the theorem may fail if the function $f$ is not continuous or the interval is not closed.

\end{example}

\begin{theorem}[Intermediate Value Theorem]
    If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and if $s$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ then there exists $c$ in $[a, b]$ s.t. $f(c) = s$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{figure}[H]

In particular, a continuous function on a closed interval takes every value between its minimum $m$ and maximum $M$. Hence its range is a closed interval $[m, M]$.
\begin{example}
    Show that the equation $x^3 - x - 1 = 0$ has a solution in the interval $[1, 2]$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
    $f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$ is a polynomial and hence continuous. $f(1) = -1$ and $f(2) = 5$. Since $0$ lies between $-1$ and $5$, the intermediate value theorem assures us that there must be a number $c$ in $[1, 2]$ such that $f(c) = 0$.
\end{solution}

\subsection*{Bisection Algorithm}
Intermediate Value Theorem is also an existence theorem. It does not say how to find $c$ in its statement. Let's try to better estimate the root of previous example. Write $f(x) = x^3 - x - 1$ and try to find a smaller interval where a root lies of
\[
    f(x) = 0.
\]
We know that a root lies in $[1, 2]$, if say that the root is $1.5$ the maximum error will be 0.5.

Now $f(1.5)=0.875 > 0$. So a root lies in $[1, 1.5]$, and if we say the root is $1.25$ then the maximum error will be $0.25$.

If this is not sufficient then compute $f(1.25)=-0.2969$, now if we say the root is $1.375$ then the error is less than $0.125$.

Next step is $f(1.1375) = 0.2246$. So a root must lie in $[1.25, 1375]$. The error is less than $0.0625$ if we say the root is $1.315$.

Going this way, we find the approximations, $1.3438$, $1.3282$, $1.3204$. Hence the root must lie in $[1.3282, 1.3204]$. So the first two decimal digits of the root are $1.32$.
% 1 is the whole number digit.

In engineering, you almost never get exact results. All you can do is lower your error below an acceptable threshold.
