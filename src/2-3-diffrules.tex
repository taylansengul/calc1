The graph of a function can not have a break at a point where it is smooth. Obvious!
\begin{theorem}
    If $f$ is differentiable at $x$ then $f$ is cts at $x$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    \[
        \lim_{h \to 0} (f(x+h) - f(x)) =
        \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
        \lim_{h \to 0} h = f'(x) 0 = 0
    \]
    This means
    \[
        \lim_{h \to 0} f(x+h)=f(x)
    \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $x$ then
    \[
        (f+g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x),
    \]
    \[
        (f-g)'(x) = f'(x) - g'(x),
    \]
    and for any constant $c$
    \[
        (c f)'(x) = c f'(x).
    \]
\end{theorem}
The proof of this theorem is easy but let's skip it.

The sum rule extends to any number of functions.
\[
    (f_1 + \cdots + f_n)'(x) = f_1'(x) + \cdots + f_n'(x).
\]

\begin{example}
    Take the derivative of
    \[
        f(x) = 5 \sqrt{x} + \frac{3}{x} - 19
    \]
\end{example}

It is NOT true that derivative of product of functions is a product of their derivatives
\begin{theorem}
    If $f$ and $g$ are diffentiable at $x$ then
    \[
        (f g)'(x) = f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x).
    \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
    Find the derivative of $f(x) = (x^2+x+1)(2x + \frac{1}{x})$.
\end{example}

The product rule can be extended to any number of functions
\[
    (f_1 f_2 f_3)' = f_1' f_2 f_3 + f_1 f_2' f_3  + f_1 f_2 f_3'
\]
\[
    (f_1 \cdots f_n)' = f_1' f_2 \cdots f_3 + f_1 f_2' f_3 \cdots f_n + \cdots + f_1 \cdots f_{n-1} f_n'.
\]

\begin{theorem}
    If $f$ is differentiable at $x$ and $f(x) \neq 0$ then $1/f$ is diff at $x$, and
    \[
        \left(\dfrac{1}{f} \right)'(x) = \dfrac{-f'(x)}{f(x)^2}.
    \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\[
    \dfrac{d}{dx} \dfrac{1}{f(x)} = \cdots = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{-1}{f(x+h) f(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\]
The result follows by limit rules and continuity of $f$.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
    Differentiate $y = \dfrac{1}{x^{2/3} + 1}$
\end{example}

Use the product rule and reciprocal rule to obtain quotient rule. If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $x$ and $g(x) \neq 0$ then
\[
    \left( \dfrac{f}{g} \right)'(x) = \left( \dfrac{1}{g}(x) f(x) \right)' = \dfrac{f'(x) g(x) - f(x) g'(x)}{g^2(x)}
\]

\begin{example}
    Find the derivative of $f(x) = \dfrac{a + b x}{m + c x}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
    Find an equation of the tangent line to $y = \dfrac{2}{3-4 \sqrt{x}}$ at the point $(1, -2)$.
\end{example}
