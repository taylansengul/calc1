\begin{example}
  Find the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle of radius R if one side of the rectangle lies along the diameter of the semicircle.

\end{example}

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
  \begin{solution}
    $(x/2)^2 + y^2 = R^2$. So
    \[
      A = x y = x \sqrt{R^2 - (x/2)^2}.
    \]
    \[
      \frac{dA}{dx} = \frac{2R^2 - x^2}{\sqrt{4R^2-x^2}}
    \]
    The derivative is zero when $x=\sqrt{2}R$. Use the first derivative test to see that this gives max area $A = R^2$.

\begin{example}
  Find the shortest distance from the origin to the curve $x^2 y^4 = 1$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  A manufacturer has 100 tons of metal that he can sell now with a profit of \$5 a ton.  For each week that he delays shipment, he can produce another 10 tons of metal.  However, for each week he waits, the profit drops 25 cents a ton.  If he can sell the metal at any time, when is the best time to sell so that his profit is maximized?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
  Let $x$ be the number of weeks to wait.
  \begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      Ship & Amount of metal & Profit per ton & Total profit \\
      \hline
      now & 100 & 5 & 500 \\
      in x weeks & $100+10x$ & $5-0.25 x$ & $500+25x-0.25 x^2$\\
      \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
  $P(x) = 500 + 25x - 2.5x^2$. Solve $P'(x) = 0$ to find $x=5$. And maximum profit is $\$562.50$.
\end{solution}
